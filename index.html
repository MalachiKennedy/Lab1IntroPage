    <p>My name is Malachi Kennedy. I am currently a 10th grader at Thomas A. Edison CTE High School. This year I am taking AP computer principles and Digital Design. I am taking this course to expand my knowledge on making and designing websites. To me web design is a class that will allow me to grow my computer skills. Web design is very important to me because I really like games and this will allow me to make my own game website. With this class I will be able to show my family how hard I work and what I can accomplish. Hopefully, this year I will be able to learn what I need. I am very excited to learn about coding and making new websites. I know not everything will be easy but if I work hard I know I will be able to accomplish anything I want to. </p>
